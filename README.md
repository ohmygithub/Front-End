Nanodegree Program Summary

Learn the fundamentals of how the web works and gain a working knowledge of the three foundational languages that power each and every website: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This Nanodegree will provide a guided, efficient path for you to learn to build beautiful, responsive websites optimized for security and performance. You’ll see the efforts of your work with each click of the browser’s refresh button!

By the end of the Nanodegree you’ll have built a diverse portfolio of projects to show employers. You’ll also have the opportunity to prepare for your new career with reviews of your online presence (resume, LinkedIn, portfolio), prepare for interviews, take part in workshops covering topics like networking and salary negotiation as well as take part in a new program facilitating job placement.

 Why Take This Nanodegree Program?

This Nanodegree program will teach you the skills required to become a Front-End Web Developer. We’ve designed this curriculum with expert web developers and hiring managers, allowing you to demonstrate your skills by completing a series of projects approved by leading employers as the critical indicators of job-readiness. Specifically, you’ll:

create a professional portfolio using HTML and the Bootstrap CSS framework
use the power of jQuery’s DOM manipulation to dynamically populate a resume with your own information
develop your very own arcade game in JavaScript with the HTML5 Canvas API
discover how to optimize your application’s perceived load time by taking the Critical Rendering Path into account
learn that frames per second isn’t just important for games and how to ensure a silky smooth experience in your applications by optimizing for 60 frames per second
explore best practices in application architecture and design patterns
build a complex mapping application using the Knockout framework and a variety of third-party API services
develop and maintain applications with the confidence test-driven development promotes, using the Jasmine testing framework

Nanodegree Program Structure

In the Nanodegree program, you’ll build six portfolio-worthy projects. Depending on your knowledge and skill level, you can either learn the necessary skills through our supporting courses, or jump into the projects directly. A summary of each of these projects, as well as links to their supporting courses are included in the sections below.

PROJECT Build a Portfolio Site

You will replicate a design mockup in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete throughout the course of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

Prepare for this project with: Intro to HTML and CSS, Responsive Web Design Fundamentals, and Responsive Images

PROJECT Interactive Resume

You will develop an interactive resume application that reads your resume content from a JSON file and dynamically displays that content within a provided template. You will use objects, functions, conditionals, and control structures to compose the content that will display on the resume.

Prepare for this project with: JavaScript Basics and Intro to jQuery

PROJECT Classic Arcade Game Clone

You will be provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools you must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

Prepare for this project with: Object-Oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas

PROJECT Website Optimization

You will optimize a provided website with a number of optimization- and performance-related issues so that it achieves a target PageSpeed score and runs at 60 frames per second.

Prepare for this project with: Website Performance Optimization and Browser Rendering Optimization

PROJECT Neighborhood Map

You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places you’d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

Prepare for this project with: Intro to AJAX and JavaScript Design Patterns

PROJECT Feed Reader Testing

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they’ve already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we’re now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That’s where you come in.

Prepare for this project with: JavaScript Testing


You’ll host all your projects on GitHub and make regular commits. If you haven’t learned version control yet, use our latest course on the topic: How to Use Git and GitHub


We will be periodically reviewing the Front-End Nanodegree curriculum - both courses and projects - and making adjustments based on student and industry feedback. We will notify active students working toward the Nanodegree about any effects updates may have on the degree requirements.
